I am a passionate gamer, programmer, Twitch Streamer and music lover. I can work with HTML, CSS and I'm learning more about Javascript and C# programming languages.
I am a good project manager. I also have a strong background in electronics including microprocessor programming.

Recently, I've been working on a Twitch interactive game called TWIT Z (The Walking Interactive Twitch Zombies). It can be found [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065980/TWIT_Z/). It is also streamed from Twitch fairly often on its own channel [here](https://wwww.twitch.tv/twitzgame).
