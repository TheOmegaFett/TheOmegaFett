## Shane W Miller (TheOmegaFett) ðŸ‘‹


I am a passionate *gamer*, *programmer*, *Twitch Streamer* and *life-long learner*. I can work with **HTML**, **CSS** and **Python**, I'm also learning more about **Javascript** and **C#** programming languages.

I also have a strong background in *electronics* including *microprocessor* programming.

I am currently studying for a Diploma in Web Development at Coder Academy.

Recently I've been practicing my skills with a collaborative game project. It's an extra project I organized for myself and my classmates to work on to enhance our collaborative development skills and put into practice what we're learning through study.

Also, I've been creating a Twitch interactive game called **TWIT Z** (The Walking Interactive Twitch Zombies).
* It can be found on Steam [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065980/TWIT_Z/). 
* It is also streamed from Twitch fairly often on its channel [here](https://wwww.twitch.tv/twitzgame).
